## Hi, I'm Ayush 👋🏽
I am currently working as an Assitant Manager in System Integration at Ola Electric.
I work with simulations to define vehicle-level technical specifications (to meet product requirements), define system-level requirements, predict thermal performance, define cooling requirement and design cooling strategies.

My research interests include:
- Computational Modeling
- Mechatronics
- Robotics
